                    <span>Created by Twitter, Bootstrap is an open source GUI-oriented web development framework. The point on the main bricks it provides.</span><br>
                    Bootstrap is a framework developed by the team of the social network Twitter. Offered in open source (under MIT license), this framework 
                    using HTML, CSS and JavaScript provides developers with tools to create a site easily. This framework is designed to develop sites with a responsive design,
                     which adapts to any type of screen, and primarily for smartphones. It provides tools with styles already in place for typographies, buttons, navigation interfaces
                      and many more.
                    Bootstrap is a collection of tools useful for creating the design (graphics, animation and interactions with the page in the browser, etc.) of websites 
                    and web applications. It is a set that contains HTML and CSS codes, forms, buttons, navigation tools and other interactive elements, as well as optional JavaScript 
                    extensions. This is one of the most popular projects on the GitHub development management platform. Bootstrap is compatible with the latest versions of major browsers, 
                    but can run degraded on older browsers. Since version 2, the framework adopts adaptive website design16, allowing projects using Bootstrap to dynamically adapt to the format of the media from which one accesses (PC, tablet, smartphone).</p>

                    Today more than 70% of websites and web applications incorporate the Bootstrap library. This adoption by web developers was made from the first hours of the official release of the first version of the library. How was Bootstrap able to hook web developers from its launch and how does it continue to appeal to them today? What was the web development ecosystem like before it came? What features have been implemented during its different versions? The rest of the article brings you concise answers to all these questions, in short this article traces the history of Bootstrap.
                    Bootstrap was created in 2011 at Twitter as an in-house solution, to address development inconsistencies within Twitter's engineering team. Basically, no code structure had been determined by engineers at Twitter at the time of the platform's development. Being a web developer or web engineer is quite a job (an art?) and each engineer does things in his own way. This may work very well in some cases, but when many engineers are working on the same project with different development approaches, inconsistencies are unavoidable. These inconsistencies can germinate and eventually become deep-rooted
                    code issues leading to uncertainty and increased maintenance time. Basically, Bootstrap is a tool developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thorton, then engineers at Twitter, to encourage their engineering team to use the same framework and thus minimize these inconsistencies. Naturally, the Bootstrap initiative has been a real success at Twitter since it has greatly increased the productivity of the team while limiting inconsistencies. Even though Bootstrap debuted as an in-house solution at Twitter, Mark and Jacob soon noticed its incredible potential. The Bootstrap framework was released in August 2011 as an open-source project on <a
                    href="https://github.com/">Github</a> . In the months that followed, thousands of developers from around the world contributed to the code and made Bootstrap the most active open-source web development project in the world. Since then, Bootstrap has become increasingly well-known and has become "the most popular front-office framework for developing responsive and mobile-first projects on the web."

                            <p>Bootstrap is a heavy library to load, this is due to the unused components in the library that are loaded at the same time as Bootstrap.

                                You can remedy this by using Bootstrap from their server instead of loading it yourself on your web page.

                                The majority of websites use Bootstrap during their design without making readjustments, so some sites look the same.
